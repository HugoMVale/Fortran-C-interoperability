## Description

Interoperation between Fortran and C is a powerful feature of modern Fortran. Once you get the gist of it, it feels quite simple and obvious, but surprisingly, there isn't any book or tutorial that explains the principles in a pedagogical manner.

So, the best way to learn interoperability is to code some examples and infer the logic. This is my attempt to do so (for myself).
